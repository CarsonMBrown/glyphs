  MJ thoughts on line grouping
    hough transform
    layout analysis
  accuracy
    blue scores

  image distortion model
    force bbox height

  use bounding box collision

  Ocular on printed Greek
  Generate accuracy model for:
    bounding boxes - see if contest code has?
    ground truth text, by character and/or total?
  explore getting AlexNet working
  get probabilistic model working for bbox size and location
    train on existing bboxes
    explore getting separation/combination of boxes working based on probabilistic model

DONE
  Ocular with more iters and/or more images
    resizing images to fit ocular without heap issues
    - DOESN't WORK, EVEN WITH GROUND TRUTH
  Ocular transcription
  make line alignment work
    binning by y?
    get median y for a line and then combine all within 1 stddev?
    split lines that are missing more than 3 character widths?
    take line slope into account
