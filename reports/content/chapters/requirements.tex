\section{Primary Objectives}

Investigate the following:

\begin{itemize}
  \item taking in an image of a single sheet of ancient papyrus with Greek glyphs written on it and return to the user the glyphs that appear and their bounding boxes of the Greek glyphs.
  \item separating the ink in the image from the rest of the image (binarize) using and save the resultant image.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Secondary Objectives}

Investigate and compare some or all of the following to generate a pipeline:

\begin{itemize}
  \item CNN based methods for glyph bounding, separation, and/or classification
  \item image distortion methods for glyph classification
  \item stochastic model based methods for glyph classification
  \item algorithmic based methods for glyph bounding and/or separation
  \item NN based methods for text line grouping
  \item algorithmic based methods for text line grouping
\end{itemize}

The following was another potential task, but the dataset did not support it, so it could not be explored in the time restraints of the project:

\begin{itemize}
  \item investigate bounding of diacritic signs of the characters and see if these can be automatically classified as well.
\end{itemize}
