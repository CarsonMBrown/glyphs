  Smoothing for Markov - NO
  log probabilies for Markov - NO
  cropping - working
  height avg, width with middle
  metrics for bounding on actual data
  fix bounding issues (attempt removing sliding window)


  accuracy
    blue scores

  kl diverivenge

  image distortion model (only if bboxes can be tight)
    force bbox height

  MJ thoughts on line grouping
    hough transform
    layout analysis

  Ocular on printed Greek
  Generate accuracy model for:
    bounding boxes - see if contest code has?
    ground truth text, by character and/or total?
  explore getting AlexNet working
  get probabilistic model working for bbox size and location
    train on existing bboxes
    explore getting separation/combination of boxes working based on probabilistic model

DONE
  Ocular with more iters and/or more images
    resizing images to fit ocular without heap issues
    - DOESN't WORK, EVEN WITH GROUND TRUTH
  Ocular transcription
  make line alignment work
    binning by y?
    get median y for a line and then combine all within 1 stddev?
    split lines that are missing more than 3 character widths?
    take line slope into account
